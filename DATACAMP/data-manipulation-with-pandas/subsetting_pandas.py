"""Subsetting columns
When working with data, you may not need all of the variables in your dataset. Square brackets ([]) can be used to select only the columns that matter to you in an order that makes sense to you. To select only "col_a" of the DataFrame df, use

df["col_a"]
To select "col_a" and "col_b" of df, use

df[["col_a", "col_b"]]

import pandas as pd

homelessness = pd.read_csv('datasets/homelessness.csv')
# Select the individuals column
individuals = homelessness['individuals']

# Print the head of the result
print(individuals.head())

# Select the state and family_members columns
state_fam = homelessness[['state', 'family_members']]

# Print the head of the result
print(state_fam.head())

# Select only the individuals and state columns, in that order
ind_state = homelessness[['individuals', 'state']]

# Print the head of the result
print(ind_state.head())

"""Subsetting rows
A large part of data science is about finding which bits of your dataset are interesting. One of the simplest techniques for this is to find a subset of rows that match some criteria. This is sometimes known as filtering rows or selecting rows.

There are many ways to subset a DataFrame, perhaps the most common is to use relational operators to return True or False for each row, then pass that inside square brackets.

dogs[dogs["height_cm"] > 60]
dogs[dogs["color"] == "tan"]
You can filter for multiple conditions at once by using the "bitwise and" operator, &.

dogs[(dogs["height_cm"] > 60) & (dogs["color"] == "tan")]

# Filter for rows where individuals is greater than 10000
ind_gt_10k = homelessness[homelessness['individuals'] > 10000]

# See the result
print(ind_gt_10k)

# Filter for rows where region is Mountain
mountain_reg = homelessness[homelessness['region'] == 'Mountain']

# See the result
print(mountain_reg)

# Filter for rows where family_members is less than 1000
# and region is Pacific
fam_lt_1k_pac = homelessness[(homelessness['family_members'] < 1000) & (homelessness['region'] == 'Pacific')]

# See the result
print(fam_lt_1k_pac)

"""Subsetting rows by categorical variables
Subsetting data based on a categorical variable often involves using the "or" operator (|) to select rows from multiple categories. This can get tedious when you want all states in one of three different regions, for example. Instead, use the .isin() method, which will allow you to tackle this problem by writing one condition instead of three separate ones.

colors = ["brown", "black", "tan"]
condition = dogs["color"].isin(colors)
dogs[condition]
homelessness is available and pandas is loaded as pd."""

# Subset for rows in South Atlantic or Mid-Atlantic regions
region_list = ['South Atlantic', 'Mid-Atlantic']

south_mid_atlantic = homelessness[homelessness['region'].isin(region_list)]

# See the result
print(south_mid_atlantic)

# The Mojave Desert states
canu = ["California", "Arizona", "Nevada", "Utah"]

# Filter for rows in the Mojave Desert states
mojave_homelessness = homelessness[homelessness['state'].isin(canu)]

# See the result
print(mojave_homelessness)
