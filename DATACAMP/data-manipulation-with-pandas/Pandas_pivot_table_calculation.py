"""Pivot temperature by city and year
It's interesting to see how temperatures for each city change over timeâ€”looking at every month results in a big table, which can be tricky to reason about. Instead, let's look at how temperatures change by year.

You can access the components of a date (year, month and day) using code of the form dataframe["column"].dt.component. For example, the month component is dataframe["column"].dt.month, and the year component is dataframe["column"].dt.year.

Once you have the year column, you can create a pivot table with the data aggregated by city and year, which you'll explore in the coming exercises.

import pandas as pd

temperatures = pd.read_csv('datasets/temperatures.csv')
print(temperatures.dtypes)
temperatures[["date"]] = temperatures[["date"]].apply(pd.to_datetime)

# Add a year column to temperatures
temperatures["year"] = temperatures["date"].dt.year

# Pivot avg_temp_c by country and city vs year
temp_by_country_city_vs_year = temperatures.pivot_table(values = "avg_temp_c", index = ["country", "city"], columns = "year")

# See the result
print(temp_by_country_city_vs_year)

"""
Subsetting pivot tables
A pivot table is just a DataFrame with sorted indexes, so the techniques you have learned already can be used to subset them. In particular, the .loc[] + slicing combination is often helpful.

# Subset for Egypt to India
temp_by_country_city_vs_year.loc["Egypt":"India"]

# Subset for Egypt, Cairo to India, Delhi
temp_by_country_city_vs_year.loc[("Egypt","Cairo"):("India","Delhi")]

# Subset in both directions at once
temp_by_country_city_vs_year.loc[("Egypt","Cairo"):("India","Delhi"),"2005":"2010"]

"""
Calculating on a pivot table
Pivot tables are filled with summary statistics, but they are only a first step to finding something insightful. Often you'll need to perform further calculations on them. A common thing to do is to find the rows or columns where the highest or lowest value occurs.

Recall from Chapter 1 that you can easily subset a Series or DataFrame to find rows of interest using a logical condition inside of square brackets. For example: series[series > value].

# Get the worldwide mean temp by year
mean_temp_by_year = temp_by_country_city_vs_year.mean()
print(mean_temp_by_year)

# Filter for the year that had the highest mean temp
print(mean_temp_by_year[mean_temp_by_year == max(mean_temp_by_year)])

# Get the mean temp by city
mean_temp_by_city = temp_by_country_city_vs_year.mean(axis = 1)

# Filter for the city that had the lowest mean temp
print(mean_temp_by_city[mean_temp_by_city == min(mean_temp_by_city)])
