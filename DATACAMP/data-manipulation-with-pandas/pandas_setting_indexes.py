Setting and removing indexes
pandas allows you to designate columns as an index. This enables cleaner code when taking subsets (as well as providing more efficient lookup under some circumstances).

In this chapter, you'll be exploring temperatures, a DataFrame of average temperatures in cities around the world. pandas is loaded as pd
"""

import pandas as pd

temperatures = pd.read_csv('datasets/temperatures.csv')

help(pd.DataFrame.reset_index)

# Look at temperatures
print(temperatures)

# Index temperatures by city
temperatures_ind = temperatures.set_index("city")

# Look at temperatures_ind
print(temperatures_ind)

# Reset the index, keeping its contents
print(temperatures_ind.reset_index())

# Reset the index, dropping its contents
print(temperatures_ind.reset_index(drop =True))

"""
Subsetting with .loc[]
The killer feature for indexes is .loc[]: a subsetting method that accepts index values. When you pass it a single argument, it will take a subset of rows.

The code for subsetting using .loc[] can be easier to read than standard square bracket subsetting, which can make your code less burdensome to maintain.

pandas is loaded as pd. temperatures and temperatures_ind are available; the latter is indexed by city"""

# Make a list of cities to subset on
cities = ["Moscow", "Saint Petersburg"]

# Subset temperatures using square brackets
print(temperatures[temperatures["city"].isin(cities)])

# Subset temperatures_ind using .loc[]
print(temperatures_ind.loc[cities])
